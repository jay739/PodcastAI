Research Question:
How can we use state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and advanced natural language  processing (NLP) techniques to develop an AI-Podcasting system that improves user experience of content  consumption?

Background:
AI will change the way the media is produced and delivered. It will be more customer oriented and  more efficient in its functioning. It can assist in the automation of the monotonous stages of the  content creation process, especially for the podcasts, and creating informative audio content for the consumers.
Podcasts  are becoming a popular way to consume information. Thus, the ability to automate some aspects of the  podcasting process may help to expand opportunities for creating and consuming audio content to more people. Given your understanding  of content creation and voice synthesis technologies, an AI-based system that creates meaningful, organized, and  high-quality audio content from various forms of text can increase user interaction.

Key Concepts:
In this project we dive into AI content creation, specifically:
•	Natural Language Processing (NLP): For summarizing content and conducting textual analysis.
•	Text to speech (TTS) technologies: For generating high-quality, natural-sounding audio from text.
•	Large Language Models (LLMs): For generating structured, coherent, and contextually relevant speech.

Dataset Information:
•	Public Repositories: Websites like Hugging Face and OpenAI contain a wealth of datasets relevant to speech and text-based information.
•	Open-Sourced Speech Datasets: Datasets like LibriSpeech and Mozilla Common Voice provide high data quality for audio to improve TTS models.
•	Research Datasets: Academic and Government Databases: Open-access datasets that include structured textual data for research.


Articles supporting the Project:
•	AI Powered Content Creation: Transforming Podcasting Through Personalization:
This project focuses on the transformative impact of AI on podcasting where NLP (Natural Language Processing) and deep learning allow for scalable and personalized content production. The authors explicate on the efficiency of AI when it comes to preserving orignal content while automating the podcasting process.
•	NewsPod: Automatic and Interactive News Podcasts 
This paper describes NewsPod a system that generates interactive news audio podcasts using NLP and TTS techniques. It organizes lots of Q&A sections with their own voices to keep the listeners  engaged. From the usability studies, the preference is significantly higher for NewsPod than for other forms of  consuming news.
•	Enhancing Rare Disease Education through AI-Driven Podcast Generation:
The search for AI enhanced podcasting for better learning on rare diseases the approach is designed to help  close knowledge gaps in rare disease management by automating audio content creation in different languages thus increasing the availability  of information to population groups.
