# AI-Podcasting System

## Research Question
**How can we use state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to develop an AI-Podcasting system that improves user experience of content consumption?**

## Background
AI is transforming the way media is produced and delivered, making it more **customer-oriented** and **efficient**. It can automate monotonous stages of the content creation process, especially for podcasts, helping create informative audio content for consumers.

Podcasts are increasingly popular for consuming information. Automating aspects of podcasting can expand opportunities for content creation and consumption. An AI-based system that generates **meaningful, organized, and high-quality audio** from text can enhance user engagement and interaction.

## Key Concepts
This project explores AI content creation through:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For summarizing content and textual analysis.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies**: To generate high-quality, natural-sounding audio from text.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: To generate structured, coherent, and contextually relevant speech.

## Dataset Information
The project will leverage various datasets for text and speech processing:

- **Public Repositories**: Hugging Face, OpenAI, and other platforms with speech and text datasets.
- **Open-Sourced Speech Datasets**: Resources like LibriSpeech and Mozilla Common Voice for improving TTS models.
- **Research Datasets**: Academic and government databases with structured textual data.
