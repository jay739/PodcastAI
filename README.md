# AI-Podcasting System

## Research Question
**How can we use state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to develop an AI-Podcasting system that improves user experience of content consumption?**

## Background
  AI will change the way the media is produced and delivered. It will be more customer oriented and  more efficient in its functioning. It can assist in the automation of the monotonous stages of the  content creation process, especially for the podcasts, and creating informative audio content for the consumers.

  Podcasts  are becoming a popular way to consume information. Thus, the ability to automate some aspects of the  podcasting process may help to expand opportunities for creating and consuming audio content to more people. Given your understanding  of content creation and voice synthesis technologies, an AI-based system that creates meaningful, organized, and  high-quality audio content from various forms of text can increase user interaction.


## Key Concepts
In this project we dive into AI content creation, specifically:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: To summarize content and conducting textual analysis.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies**: To generate high-quality, natural-sounding audio from text.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: To generate structured, coherent, and contextually relevant speech.

## Dataset Information
- **Public Repositories**: Hugging Face, OpenAI, and other platforms with speech and text datasets.
- **Open-Sourced Speech Datasets**: Resources like LibriSpeech and Mozilla Common Voice for improving TTS models.
- **Research Datasets**: Open-access Academic and government databases with structured textual data.

## Articles Supporting the Project
### 1. AI Powered Content Creation: Transforming Podcasting Through Personalization
  This project focuses on the transformative impact of AI on podcasting where NLP (Natural Language Processing) and deep learning allow for scalable and personalized content production. The authors explicate on the efficiency of AI when it comes to preserving orignal content while automating the podcasting process.

### 2. NewsPod: Automatic and Interactive News Podcasts
  This paper describes NewsPod a system that generates interactive news audio podcasts using NLP and TTS techniques. It organizes lots of Q&A sections with their own voices to keep the listeners  engaged. From the usability studies, the preference is significantly higher for NewsPod than for other forms of  consuming news.

### 3. Enhancing Rare Disease Education through AI-Driven Podcast Generation
  The search for AI enhanced podcasting for better learning on rare diseases the approach is designed to help  close knowledge gaps in rare disease management by automating audio content creation in different languages thus increasing the availability  of information to population groups.
